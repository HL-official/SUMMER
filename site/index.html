      <div id="h1">Hamburger, USA</div>
      <div id="p1"> The hamburger has its roots in Germany and is named after the city of Hamburg where, during the 19th century, local beef was ground and mixed with onions and garlic and then formed into patties. But the dish we know and love today is no doubt an American icon. The modern incarnation is attributed to several Americans and is an essential part of the American food culture.</div>

      <div id="h2">Tacos, Mexico</div>
      <div id = "p2"> These soft corn tortillas full of delicious beef, pork and chicken have mysterious origins that are often traced back to Mexico's 18th-century silver mines. Contrary to American tacos, the Mexican version doesn't include garnishes like lettuce, tomato, cheese or even sour cream. In fact, Mexican tacos are usually topped with coriander, finely diced white onion and a type of salsa or, sometimes, guacamole. </div>

      <div id="h3">Pizza, Italy</div>
      <div id="p3"> If ever a foodstuff needed no introduction it would be pizza. And if any pizza can lay claim to being the forebearer of an international obsession, it’s the pizza Napoletana hailing from Naples in Italy. Made specifically with Mozzarella di Bufala Campana and either San Marzano or Roma tomatoes, it then has to be cooked precisely 60 to 90 seconds in 485ºC (905ºF) in a wood-fired oven.</div>
